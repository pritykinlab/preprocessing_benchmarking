# TO DO
- add sctransform
- add CITE-seq
- need to make file mapping system in order to use files as arguements (can't use argument values in filename of intermediate files)
- highly variable genes need to go to the max value (edit the metadata to say how many genes are at max then pass that as the argument)

# Long Term To Do:
- subsets of the data (in rare subpopulations, I suspect that more HVG better because, a gene might not be HVG unless if you have enough cells of the small subpopulation)
