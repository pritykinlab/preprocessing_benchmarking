# Dillon To Do:
- normalize the metric
- remove controls from the metric

# Yujie To Do:
- run a test with max hvg, test num_PCs: make plots: 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80. 90, 100, 125, 150, 175, 200
- many dataset from large dataset
- identify the control cells (add a new boolean column into adata.obs "is_control_or_not")
- prepare a slide to explain zscore methods
- automate the plot script

# TO DO 1
- where are the replicates are there any


# Long Term To Do:
- subsets of the data (in rare subpopulations, I suspect that more HVG better because, a gene might not be HVG unless if you have enough cells of the small subpopulation)
