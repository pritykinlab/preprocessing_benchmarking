# TO DO
## Dillon
First do:
- min cells (0.5% of cells)
- total counts (10 counts per cells)

Remove the intermediate files

## Yujie
HVG linked with different normalization
- Pearson Residual Norm + Pearson Residual
- scTransform
- seuart + norm log zscore
- seurat + norm log
- Pearson Residuals Norm + Norm Log zscore

## Yujie
PC = [25, 50, 100]
Different k=20, 40

# scRNA-seq preprocessing benchmarking

### Flexible pipeline

- main.py

- pipeline.py (fixed)



# Long Term To Do:
- subsets of the data (in rare subpopulations, I suspect that more HVG better because, a gene might not be HVG unless if you have enough cells of the small subpopulation)
