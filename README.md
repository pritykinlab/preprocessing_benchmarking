# Dillon To Do:
- normalize the metric

# Yujie To Do:
- aggregate the results by doing zscore then plotting all of the results on one dataset (num_PCs x num_k x num_norm plots)
- many dataset from large dataset

# TO DO 1
- identify the control cells
- where are the replicates are there any
- remove controls from the metric

# Long Term To Do:
- subsets of the data (in rare subpopulations, I suspect that more HVG better because, a gene might not be HVG unless if you have enough cells of the small subpopulation)
